TwoFactor blog

well in laravel there are many ways to implement two factor auth but i'll walk through how i implement two factor api in my open source project profresh api layer ill just walk you through to the backend layer of its implementation im using larager ill atttach the link of repo for you to check both backend and frontend code 
as this is for the backend ill hopefully that you fully knowledge of sanctum i dont go to small point just straight into its implementation
for test you can also see its into its repo
first install laragear im using laravel 1o so i install its 2nd version for version 3 its more or less a same code you can check its documentation 
first lests see the two factor congtroller code 

when user select two factor auth it hists api with the following controler code

 public function prepareTwoFactor(PrepareTwoFactorRequest $request): JsonResponse
    {
        $user = $request->user();
        $secret = $user->createTwoFactorAuth();

        return response()->json([
            'qr_code' => $secret->toQr(),
            'uri'     => $secret->toUri(),
            'string'  => $secret->toString(),
            'status'  => TwoFactorStatus::IN_PROGRESS->value,
        ], 200);
    }

    (check PrepareTwoFactorRequest form request for its validation it just contain basic validation to ask user current password and check that if validtaion is not already enabled)

    we get user make two factor in pending state and return response with qr code the qr code is generate 
    next once the user scan qr code get auth (you can use google authy for that) enter its code in form then hit enter the following code execute 

public function confirmTwoFactor(ConfirmTwoFactorRequest $request): JsonResponse
    {
        $user = $request->user();

        return response()->json([
            'message' => TwoFactorStatus::SUCCESS->value,
            'recoveryCodes' => $user->getRecoveryCodes(),
            'status' => TwoFactorStatus::ENABLED->value,
        ]);
    }

    its just confirm user two factor and make status enable 
    here is the enum class 


namespace App\Enums;

enum TwoFactorStatus: string
{
    case ENABLED = 'enabled';
    case IN_PROGRESS = 'in_progress';
    case DISABLED = 'disabled';
    case TWO_FA_REQUIRED = '2fa_required';
    case SUCCESS = 'success';
} 


it has has Confirm Two factor request which do the basic but importnat validation check

for now the user two factor auth is enabaled 

you can show recovery code like this 
public function showRecoveryCodes(Request $request): JsonResponse
    {
        $recoveryCodes = $request->user()->generateRecoveryCodes();

        return response()->json([
            'message' => TwoFactorStatus::SUCCESS->value,
            'recoveryCodes' => $recoveryCodes,
        ]);
    }

    and disable two auth like this 
     public function disableTwoFactorAuth(DisableTwoFactorRequest $request): JsonResponse
    {
        $request->user()->disableTwoFactorAuth();
        
        return response()->json([
            'message' => 'Two-Factor Authentication has been disabled!',
            'status' => TwoFactorStatus::DISABLED->value,
        ]);
    }

    it also contains DisableTwo factor check which do minimal validation check 

    this will complete your two factor setup but you need 
    to secure your login when user login and its two factor enabled 
    now we implement its methadology 
    first you need to check if user two factor enabled in login controller
     public function login(LoginUserRequest $request): JsonResponse
    {
        if(session('2fa_login')){
            session()->forget('2fa_login');
        }

        $user = $this->loginUserService->attemptLogin($request->email, $request->password);

        UserLogin::dispatchIf(!$user->timezone, $user);

        if ($this->loginUserService->handleTwoFactor($user, $request->email, $request->password)) {
            return response()->json([
                'message' => 'Two-factor authentication is enabled. Please provide the verification code.',
                'status' => '2fa_required',
            ], 200);
        }
        

        return response()->json([
            'message'=> 'User authenticated successfully',
            'user' => new UsersResource($user),
            'status' => 'success',
            'access_token' => $user->createToken(
                'Api Token for ' . $user->email,
                ['*'],
                now()->addMonth())->plainTextToken,
        ], 200);
    }

    if user twofactor login we use loginUserService class otherwise carry on traditional login
    if twofactor enable then we setup two factor session 
        public function handleTwoFactor($user, $email, $password)
    {
        if ($user->hasTwoFactorEnabled()) {
            session(['2fa_login' => encrypt([
                'email' => $email,
                'password' => $password,
                'expires_at' => now()->addMinutes(5)
            ])]);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

and redirect user to two factor login controller

    here is twofactor login controller 

       public function twoFactorLogin(TwoFactorLoginRequest $request): JsonResponse
    {
        $user = $request->user();
        
        // Clear the 2FA session after successful login
        session()->forget('2fa_login');
        
        return response()->json([
            'message' => 'User authenticated successfully',
            'user' => new UsersResource($user),
            'status' => TwoFactorStatus::SUCCESS->value,
            'access_token' => $user->createToken(
                'Api Token for ' . $user->email,
                ['*'],
                now()->addMonth()
            )->plainTextToken,
        ], 200);
    }

    here we see we setup TwoFactorLoginRequest 

    first we validate code 
    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'code' => [
                'required',
                'digits:6',
            ],
        ];
    }

     public function withValidator($validator): void
    {
        $validator->after(function ($validator) {
             $code = $this->input('code'); 
            $this->validateTwoFactorSession($validator,$code);
        });
    }

    then we validate session
    for full request class you can check request class code in github repo 
    
    please feel free to reach out to me thanks
    additinoly you can use middleware to your route provided by package
    here is a complete route setup
    Route::controller(TwoFactorController::class)
    ->prefix('twofactor')
    ->name('twofactor.')
    ->group(function () {
        Route::post('setup', 'prepareTwoFactor')->name('setup');
        Route::post('confirm', 'confirmTwoFactor')->name('confirm');
        Route::get('fetch-user', 'getUserStatus')->name('fetch-user');
        Route::get('recovery-codes', 'showRecoveryCodes')->middleware('2fa.enabled')->name('recovery-codes');
        Route::delete('disable', 'disableTwoFactorAuth')->name('disable');
        Route::post('login-confirm', 'twoFactorLogin')->name('login-confirm')->withoutMiddleware(['auth:sanctum']);
    });
